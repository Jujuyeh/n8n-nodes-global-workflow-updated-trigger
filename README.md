# n8n-nodes-global-workflow-updated-trigger

A **global trigger node** for [n8n](https://n8n.io) that emits an item whenever **any workflow in your n8n instance** gets updated.

[![CI](https://github.com/Jujuyeh/n8n-nodes-global-workflow-updated-trigger/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Jujuyeh/n8n-nodes-global-workflow-updated-trigger/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


Since n8n Community Edition doesn't expose a global ‚Äúworkflow updated‚Äù event, this node implements **light internal polling** with persistent state to detect changes without noise or duplicates.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Detects updates across all workflows in your n8n instance.
- Emits one item per updated workflow.
- Optionally includes the full workflow JSON.
- Persists state (`lastSync` and per-ID map) to avoid duplicates.
- Optional Basic Auth support for secured instances.

Option             |	Description
-------------------|------------------------------------------------------
Base URL	       | Usually http://localhost:5678 inside the container

## üîÑ Example Output

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Daily Report",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-29T12:34:56.000Z",
  "workflow": {
    "id": 42,
    "name": "Daily Report",
    "nodes": [...],
    "connections": {...}
  }
}
```

## üß† Best Practices
 - Set the regex to ignore this trigger‚Äôs own workflow.
 - Keep the polling interval modest (‚â•5s).
 - Use this node to drive GitHub or S3 backup workflows.
 - Combine with HTTP ‚Üí GitHub ‚ÄúCreate/Update file‚Äù to version-control your workflows.
